# Vin Decoder

Built using the [NTHSA Vehicle API](https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/api/), Svelte, and Node.js


This is currently just a work in progress, but I would like to add more error checking for vehicle information, along with more unique styling to the frontend.


## Build
To run the project first build the Svelte compontents:
```bash
npm run build
```

Then start the web server: 
```bash
npm run start
```

After this, the project should be visible at `http://localhost:5000/`


## Hot Reloading

If you would like to modify this project and see your components update in real time:

```bash
npm run dev
